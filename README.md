Synthetic Data

  Gaussian Distribution (d1):
  Mean: [0.0, 0.0]
  Covariance Matrix: [[10, 4],
                      [4, 13]]
  
  Exponential Distribution (d2):
  Scale parameter (Î»): 0.5

  Student's t-Distribution (d3):
  Mean: [0.0, 0.0]
  degrees of freedom: 3
  Covariance Matrix: [[5.0, 2.0],
                      [2.0, 6.2]]


Visualization

The script visualizes the synthetic data points along with the principal components (PCs) computed using PCA for each distribution:
    Gaussian Distribution:
    Exponential Distribution:
    Student's t-Distribution:

In each plot:
    Black dots represent the generated data points.
    Red and blue arrows represent the first and second principal components (PCs) computed using PCA, respectively.
